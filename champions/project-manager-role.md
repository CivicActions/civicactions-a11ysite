Project managers keep teams aligned and delivery predictable. Embedding accessibility into schedules, risks, and communications keeps it from slipping.

## Project manager actions

- Add accessibility tasks to sprint plans and milestones; avoid “phase later” deferrals.
- Track risks for accessibility regressions and surface them in status reports.
- Ensure time is allocated for manual checks (keyboard, screen reader smoke tests, zoom/contrast) before release.
- Coordinate user testing that includes people with disabilities and assistive tech.
