Developers make accessibility real by shipping usable, resilient components. Focus on semantic HTML first, progressive enhancement, and guardrails like linting and CI checks.

## How developers move accessibility forward

- Build semantic structures (landmarks, headings, lists, form labels) so assistive tech has a reliable model of the page.
- Ensure all interactions are keyboard-friendly with visible focus and logical tab order.
- Integrate automated testing (axe, pa11y-ci) plus a small manual checklist (screen reader smoke test, zoom/contrast check) in every change.
- Collaborate with designers and content authors to catch issues before code freeze.
