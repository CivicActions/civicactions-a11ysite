Product managers turn accessibility into roadmap reality. They balance user needs, scope, and delivery so accessible experiences ship and stay maintained.

## Product manager actions

- Define accessibility as a core acceptance criterion for every epic and user story.
- Prioritize fixes based on user impact and risk, not just compliance severity.
- Schedule recurring audits (automated and manual) and track debt in the backlog.
- Coordinate with design, engineering, QA, and content so accessibility stays aligned across releases.
