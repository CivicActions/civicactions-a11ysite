Operations leaders keep accessibility sustainable by standardizing processes, tooling, and support.

## Operations actions

- Bake accessibility checks into definition of done, release checklists, and incident response.
- Maintain component libraries and design systems with documented accessibility patterns.
- Track accessibility defects with SLAs and triage rules so regressions are fixed quickly.
- Ensure vendors and contractors follow the same standards and reporting cadence.
