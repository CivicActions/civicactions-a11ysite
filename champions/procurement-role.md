Procurement teams decide which products and vendors reach users. Setting accessibility expectations early prevents expensive rework.

## Procurement actions

- Require current Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACR/VPAT) for products under evaluation.
- Ask vendors about testing practices, assistive tech coverage, and remediation timelines.
- Include accessibility acceptance criteria in contracts and SOWs.
- Track post-award accessibility bugs and hold vendors accountable to fix SLAs.
