Executives set the tone and resourcing for accessibility. Clear priorities, budget, and accountability make accessible delivery possible across teams.

## Executive actions

- Make accessibility a success metric in roadmaps and OKRs; track defects and user outcomes, not just compliance.
- Fund training and assistive tech so teams can test with real tools and people with disabilities.
- Require accessibility criteria in vendor selection and procurement.
- Publish and maintain an accessibility statement with a feedback channel.
