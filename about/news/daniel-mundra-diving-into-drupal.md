# Daniel Mundra: Diving Into Drupal

Meet Daniel Mundra, one of CivicActions' accessibility engineers who brings deep Drupal expertise to government accessibility projects and has been instrumental in developing our automated testing approaches.

## Background and Journey

Daniel's path to accessibility engineering combines technical depth with a passion for inclusive technology. With a background in full-stack web development and a particular expertise in Drupal, he discovered accessibility through working on government projects where Section 508 compliance was not just nice-to-have, but legally required.

### From Developer to Accessibility Engineer
"I started noticing how many barriers existed in the websites we were building," Daniel explains. "Even with the best intentions, we were inadvertently creating experiences that didn't work for people using screen readers or keyboard navigation. That realization completely changed how I approach development."

### Drupal Community Involvement
Daniel has become a significant contributor to Drupal's accessibility initiatives:
- **Core accessibility patches** improving Drupal's built-in accessibility features
- **Accessibility module development** for enhanced testing and compliance
- **Community training** at DrupalCons and accessibility camps
- **Documentation improvements** making Drupal accessibility guidance more comprehensive

## Technical Expertise

### Drupal Accessibility Specialization
Daniel's work focuses on making Drupal-based government websites fully accessible:
- **Theme accessibility** ensuring Drupal themes meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Module accessibility audit** evaluating contributed modules for accessibility compliance
- **Administrative interface accessibility** making content editing accessible to users with disabilities
- **Migration accessibility** preserving and improving accessibility during site redesigns

### Automated Testing Innovation
A key area of Daniel's work involves developing automated accessibility testing workflows:
- **CI/CD integration** bringing accessibility testing into development pipelines
- **Custom testing scripts** for government-specific accessibility requirements
- **Tool evaluation** comparing and optimizing accessibility testing tools for Drupal
- **False positive reduction** making automated testing more accurate and actionable

### Government Project Experience
Daniel has worked on accessibility for several high-profile government projects:
- **Federal agency website redesigns** meeting Section 508 compliance requirements
- **State government portal accessibility** improving citizen service access
- **Local government digital transformation** with accessibility as a core requirement
- **Cross-agency accessibility standardization** developing shared approaches and tools

## Contributions to CivicActions Accessibility Practice

### Automated Testing Framework
Daniel led the development of CivicActions' automated accessibility testing approach:
- **Multi-tool integration** combining axe-core, Pa11y, and custom testing scripts
- **Government compliance reporting** automatically generating Section 508 compliance documentation
- **Performance optimization** ensuring accessibility testing doesn't slow down development
- **Team training** helping developers integrate accessibility testing into their workflows

### Drupal Accessibility Resources
His work has produced numerous resources for the Drupal and accessibility communities:
- **Drupal accessibility checklist** specifically designed for government compliance
- **Module accessibility reviews** evaluating popular Drupal modules for accessibility issues
- **Training materials** used in CivicActions' Drupal accessibility workshops
- **Case studies** documenting successful government Drupal accessibility implementations

### Mentorship and Knowledge Sharing
Daniel is passionate about developing accessibility expertise in others:
- **Junior developer mentorship** bringing new team members up to speed on accessibility
- **Cross-team collaboration** working with designers and project managers on accessibility integration
- **Client education** helping government teams understand and maintain accessibility standards
- **Community speaking** sharing lessons learned at conferences and meetups

## Philosophy and Approach

### Accessibility as Quality Assurance
"Accessibility testing isn't separate from quality assurance—it's an essential part of it," Daniel emphasizes. "If a website doesn't work with assistive technology, it's broken, period."

### User-Centered Development
Daniel advocates for involving people with disabilities throughout the development process:
- **User testing integration** including assistive technology users in QA workflows
- **Real-world validation** testing beyond automated tools to ensure actual usability
- **Feedback integration** incorporating user feedback into development priorities
- **Empathy building** helping development teams understand the impact of accessibility barriers

### Sustainable Accessibility
Rather than accessibility as an add-on, Daniel focuses on building sustainable accessibility practices:
- **Developer training** so teams can maintain accessibility without constant external support
- **Process integration** making accessibility testing part of standard workflows
- **Tool optimization** reducing the burden of accessibility compliance through better tooling
- **Long-term planning** ensuring accessibility considerations are part of technical architecture decisions

## Current Projects and Initiatives

### Open Source Drupal Accessibility
Daniel continues contributing to Drupal's accessibility improvements:
- **Core accessibility enhancements** submitted as patches for Drupal core
- **Accessibility testing module** development for easier Drupal accessibility validation
