# Helping Disabled Veterans Check-in: Designing an Accessibility Map

When the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) asked CivicActions to improve the digital check-in experience for disabled veterans, we knew we needed to go beyond standard accessibility compliance. This case study explores how we created an accessibility map that guides veterans through complex healthcare facilities while accommodating diverse disabilities and assistive technology needs.

## The Challenge

### Veterans' Unique Needs
Veterans accessing VA healthcare services face multiple challenges:
- **Service-connected disabilities** requiring specific accommodations and assistance
- **Trauma-related conditions** that can make navigation and wayfinding particularly difficult  
- **Age-related accessibility needs** as many veterans are older adults with vision, hearing, or mobility challenges
- **Technology gaps** with varying levels of comfort and experience with digital interfaces

### Facility Complexity
VA medical centers present navigation challenges:
- **Large, complex buildings** with multiple wings, floors, and service areas
- **Frequent construction** and temporary changes affecting routes and accessibility
- **Multiple check-in points** for different types of appointments and services
- **Limited wayfinding** systems that may not account for accessibility needs

### Existing System Limitations
The previous check-in process had significant barriers:
- **Text-heavy interfaces** difficult for people with cognitive disabilities or low literacy
- **Small touch targets** problematic for users with motor disabilities or tremors
- **No audio guidance** excluding users who are blind or have low vision
- **Inconsistent accessibility** across different systems and kiosks

## Our Research Approach

### User Research with Veterans
We conducted extensive research with veterans who have disabilities:

#### Interview Process
- **One-on-one interviews** with 24 veterans representing diverse disabilities
- **Facility observations** watching real check-in processes and identifying pain points
- **Assistive technology testing** observing how veterans use screen readers, voice recognition, and mobility aids
- **Family and caregiver input** understanding how support people assist with navigation

#### Key Findings
Veterans told us:
- **"I get lost every time I come here, even after 10 years"** - highlighting ongoing wayfinding challenges
- **"The kiosk is too high and I can't reach it from my wheelchair"** - physical accessibility barriers
- **"I can't read the small text and there's no way to make it bigger"** - visual accessibility needs
- **"My hands shake and I keep hitting the wrong buttons"** - motor accessibility requirements

### Disability-Specific Research
We studied how different disabilities affect navigation:

#### Vision Disabilities
- **Blindness**: Need for audio descriptions of routes and landmarks
- **Low vision**: Require high contrast, large text, and good lighting information
- **Color blindness**: Cannot rely on color-coded wayfinding systems

#### Hearing Disabilities
- **Deafness**: Need visual alerts and written directions
- **Hard of hearing**: Benefit from visual supplements to audio announcements
- **Processing difficulties**: Require clear, simple language and repeated information

#### Motor Disabilities
- **Wheelchair users**: Need accessible routes, elevator locations, and appropriate counter heights
- **Limited mobility**: Require shortest accessible paths and rest area information
- **Hand/arm disabilities**: Need alternative input methods and larger touch targets

#### Cognitive Disabilities
- **Memory issues**: Benefit from step-by-step guidance and landmark-based directions
- **Processing disabilities**: Need simple language and clear visual hierarchy
- **PTSD/anxiety**: Require calming design and options to avoid crowded areas
