# Launching a Community of Practice for Accessibility in Government Services

CivicActions is proud to support the launch of a new cross-agency community of practice focused on accessibility in government digital services, bringing together accessibility professionals from federal, state, and local agencies to share knowledge and coordinate improvements.

## The Vision

Government agencies face similar accessibility challenges but often work in isolation. This community of practice creates a structured way for accessibility professionals across all levels of government to:

- **Share successful strategies** for implementing accessibility in government contexts
- **Coordinate on common challenges** like procurement, vendor management, and compliance
- **Develop shared resources** that benefit the entire government accessibility community
- **Advocate collectively** for improved accessibility policies and funding

## Community Structure

### Monthly Meetings
- **Third Thursday of each month** - Virtual meetings accommodating different time zones
- **Rotating facilitation** - Different agencies host and lead discussions
- **Structured agenda** with presentations, case studies, and open discussion
- **Meeting recordings** available for members who cannot attend live

### Working Groups
Specialized groups focused on specific areas:

#### Procurement and Vendor Management
- **Accessibility requirements** for government contracts
- **Vendor evaluation criteria** and accessibility testing protocols
- **Contract language templates** for accessibility compliance
- **Shared vendor accessibility assessments** and recommendations

#### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Standardized testing methodologies** across agencies
- **Tool evaluation and recommendations** for government use
- **Training protocols** for government QA teams
