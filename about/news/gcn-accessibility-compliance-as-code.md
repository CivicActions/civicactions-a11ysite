# GCN: Accessibility Compliance as Code

This article will cover approaches for defining accessibility compliance rules as machine-enforceable checks, integrating them into CI/CD pipelines, and exploring how government agencies can adopt compliance-as-code to scale accessibility assurance across multiple services.

**Editorial notes:** placeholder migrated; expand from original site content and add examples (lint rules, policy-as-code snippets, enforcement strategies).
