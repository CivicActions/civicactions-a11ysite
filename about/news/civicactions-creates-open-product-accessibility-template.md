# CivicActions Creates Open Product Accessibility Template

CivicActions has developed and released an open source template to help organizations create comprehensive product accessibility documentation, making it easier for teams to communicate accessibility features and compliance status.

## The Need for Accessible Product Documentation

Product accessibility information is often scattered across multiple documents or missing entirely, making it difficult for:

- **Procurement teams** to evaluate accessibility compliance
- **Development teams** to understand accessibility requirements
- **Users with disabilities** to learn about available accessibility features
- **Legal and compliance teams** to document accessibility efforts

## What's in the Template

The open source template provides a structured approach to documenting:

### Accessibility Conformance Information
- **WCAG 2.1 compliance level** and detailed conformance claims
- **Section 508 compliance** status for government customers
- **Assistive technology compatibility** testing results
- **Known limitations** and planned improvements

### User-Focused Feature Documentation
- **Available accessibility features** described in plain language
- **How to enable and use** accessibility settings
- **Keyboard shortcuts** and alternative interaction methods
- **Contact information** for accessibility support

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Accessibility API support** (ARIA, platform-specific APIs)
- **Testing methodology** and tools used for validation
- **Third-party component accessibility** assessment
- **Update and maintenance processes** for accessibility features

### Legal and Compliance Framework
- **Accessibility policy** statements and organizational commitment
- **Feedback mechanisms** for users to report accessibility issues
- **Remediation timeline** commitments for identified issues
- **Training and awareness programs** for development teams

## Key Benefits
