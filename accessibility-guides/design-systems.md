# Design Systems

An introduction to accessible design systems and how to implement them effectively.

## What are Design Systems?

Design systems are collections of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build digital products. When built with accessibility in mind, they ensure consistent, inclusive experiences across all touchpoints.

## Benefits for Accessibility

- **Consistent patterns** reduce cognitive load
- **Pre-tested components** minimize accessibility bugs
- **Clear guidelines** help teams build inclusively
- **Scalable solutions** across large organizations

## Key Principles

### 1. Built-in Accessibility
Components should be accessible by default, not as an afterthought.

### 2. Clear Documentation
Every component should include accessibility guidance and usage examples.

### 3. Testing Integration
Automated and manual testing should be built into the design system workflow.

## Recommended Systems

### U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)
The gold standard for government digital services, with accessibility built into every component.

**Why we recommend USWDS:**
- Section 508 compliant by design
- Extensive accessibility documentation
- Active community and maintenance
- Proven in production across federal agencies

### Other Notable Systems
- **Material Design** - Google's design system with accessibility guidelines
- **Carbon Design System** - IBM's comprehensive system with accessibility focus
- **Atlassian Design System** - Strong accessibility documentation and testing

## Implementation Guide

Step-by-step approach to building or adopting an accessible design system for your organization.
