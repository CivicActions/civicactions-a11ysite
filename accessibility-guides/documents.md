# Editor Notes
recommendations: "Add explanatory text. Develop the CivicActions Accessibility viewpoint on documents. Reduce the number of links if not all of them are necessary. Highlight preferred resources for documents. Check remaining links to make sure they work and are still leading to relevant content."

# Documents

Creating accessible documents that work for everyone, including people using assistive technologies.

## The CivicActions Approach to Document Accessibility

Document accessibility is about ensuring information is available to all users, regardless of how they access it. Whether someone is using a screen reader, has low vision, or cognitive differences, well-structured documents provide better experiences for everyone.

## Document Types and Accessibility

### PDFs
**Best practices**:
- Create accessible PDFs from the source (Word, InDesign, etc.)
- Include proper heading structure and reading order
- Add alternative text for images and complex graphics
- Ensure forms are properly labeled and navigable
- Test with screen readers before publishing

**CivicActions recommendation**: When possible, provide HTML alternatives to PDFs for better accessibility and mobile compatibility.

### Microsoft Word Documents
**Essential elements**:
- Use built-in heading styles (Heading 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Add alternative text to images through right-click menu
- Use meaningful link text instead of "click here"
- Include table headers and structure
- Run built-in accessibility checker before sharing

### Google Docs
**Key features**:
- Utilize heading styles from the toolbar
- Add alt text through image options
- Use voice typing for dictation needs
- Enable screen reader support in accessibility settings
- Share documents with proper viewing permissions

### PowerPoint Presentations
**Accessibility priorities**:
- Use slide layouts with proper heading hierarchy
- Provide alternative text for images and charts
- Ensure sufficient color contrast in designs
- Include slide titles for navigation
- Consider providing transcript or notes for complex presentations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Before You Start
1. **Choose the right format** - HTML is most accessible, followed by well-structured documents
2. **Plan your structure** - Outline headings and key information hierarchy
3. **Gather accessible assets** - Ensure images have alt text, videos have captions

### During Creation
1. **Use semantic structure** - Headers, lists, and proper formatting
2. **Write descriptive links** - Link text should make sense out of context
3. **Test as you go** - Use built-in accessibility checkers
4. **Consider reading order** - Information should flow logically

### Before Publishing
1. **Final accessibility check** - Run automated and manual tests
2. **Test with assistive technology** - Try navigating with keyboard only
3. **Verify file size and format** - Ensure documents are manageable for all users
4. **Provide alternatives** - Consider multiple formats when appropriate

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Heading Structure Problems
- **Issue**: Skipping heading levels or using visual formatting instead of semantic headings
- **Solution**: Use proper heading hierarchy (H1→H2→H3) with built-in styles

### Image Accessibility
- **Issue**: Missing or poor alternative text for images
- **Solution**: Write descriptive alt text focusing on the image's purpose and content

### Link Accessibility  
- **Issue**: Unclear link text like "click here" or "read more"
- **Solution**: Use descriptive link text that makes sense when read alone

### Table Structure
- **Issue**: Tables without proper headers or complex layouts
- **Solution**: Use simple table structures with clear column and row headers
