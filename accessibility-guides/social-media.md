# Social Media Accessibility

Creating inclusive social media content that reaches and engages all users, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technologies they use.

## Why Social Media Accessibility Matters

Social media platforms are primary communication channels for organizations, but default practices often exclude people with disabilities. Accessible social media ensures your message reaches everyone and demonstrates organizational commitment to inclusion.

## Essential Practices

### Alternative Text for Images
**Write descriptive alt text**:
- **Describe the content and function** of the image
- **Keep it concise** but informative (under 125 characters when possible)
- **Skip redundant phrases** like "image of" or "picture showing"
- **Include text that appears in images** when relevant to the message

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Photo"
- ❌ "Image of people in a meeting"
- ✅ "Team members collaborating around a laptop, reviewing accessibility audit results"

### Hashtag Accessibility
**Use CamelCase for multi-word hashtags**:
- ❌ #accessibilitymatters
- ✅ #AccessibilityMatters

**Why it helps**: Screen readers can properly pronounce each word in the hashtag

### Video and Audio Content
**Provide captions and transcripts**:
- **Add captions** to all videos, even short clips
- **Include transcript text** in post descriptions when possible
- **Describe important visual information** that isn't conveyed through audio
- **Use auto-captions as a starting point** but always edit for accuracy

### Link Accessibility
**Use descriptive link text**:
- ❌ "Check out this link: bit.ly/xyz123"
- ✅ "Read our new accessibility guide: [full URL or descriptive text]"

**Avoid URL shorteners when possible** - they hide destination information from users

## Platform-Specific Guidelines

### Twitter/X
- **Use alt text feature** for images (available in compose window)
- **Limit emoji use** and place them at end of posts (screen readers read emoji names)
- **Use CamelCase hashtags** for readability
- **Provide context** for quoted tweets or referenced content

### LinkedIn
- **Write descriptive headlines** for shared articles
- **Use document alt text** when sharing PDFs or images
- **Structure long posts** with clear paragraphs and headings
- **Tag people thoughtfully** - consider if mentions are necessary

### Facebook
- **Use built-in alt text editor** for photos
- **Provide video descriptions** in post text
- **Structure event information** clearly with headings and lists
- **Consider accessibility of linked content** before sharing

### Instagram
- **Write detailed alt text** using the accessibility feature
- **Include key information** from Stories in captions
- **Use descriptive captions** for video content
- **Consider story accessibility** for time-sensitive content

## The Accessible Social Project

### Alexa Heinrich's Experiment-Driven Approach
The [Accessible Social project](https://accessible-social.com/) provides evidence-based guidance for social media accessibility through systematic testing and user research.

**Key insights from Accessible Social**:
- **Real user testing** with people who use assistive technologies
- **Platform-specific recommendations** based on actual user experience
- **Continuous updates** as platforms evolve their accessibility features
- **Practical examples** showing good and problematic practices

**Recommended starting point**: Review Accessible Social's platform guides before developing your organization's social media accessibility strategy.

## Content Strategy Considerations

### Planning Accessible Content
1. **Include accessibility in content calendar** planning
2. **Train social media team** on accessibility practices
3. **Create templates** for common post types with accessibility built in
4. **Budget time** for alt text, captions, and other accessibility features

### Quality Assurance
1. **Review posts** for accessibility before publishing
2. **Test with assistive technology** when possible
3. **Monitor engagement** from users with disabilities
4. **Update practices** based on user feedback and platform changes

### Crisis Communication and Accessibility
- **Prepare accessible templates** for urgent communications
- **Include alt text** even in time-sensitive posts
- **Use clear, plain language** for emergency information
- **Provide multiple formats** for critical information (text, video with captions, etc.)

## Tools and Resources

### Built-in Platform Features
- **Alt text editors** on major platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn)
- **Auto-captioning** for videos (YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- **Accessibility checkers** in platform publishing tools
- **Analytics tools** for measuring inclusive engagement

### External Tools
- **Caption generation**: Rev, Otter.ai, or platform-native tools
- **Alt text assistance**: AI tools as starting points (always review and edit)
- **Color contrast checkers**: For graphics and text overlays
- **Screen readers**: Test your content with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver

### Measurement and Improvement
- **Track accessibility engagement**: Monitor how accessible content performs
