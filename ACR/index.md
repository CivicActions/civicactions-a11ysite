We produce Accessibility Conformance Reports (ACRs) and Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates (VPATs) for our Drupal implementations. These summaries help procurement and security teams understand how our solutions align with WCAG 2.1 and Section 508.

Available reports:

- [Drupal 9 ACR](./Drupal9AccessibilityConformanceReport/)
- [Drupal 9 ACR (December 2020)](./Drupal9AccessibilityConformanceReport-December2020/)

If you need the most recent report or a product-specific assessment, email [accessibility@civicactions.com](mailto:accessibility@civicactions.com).
