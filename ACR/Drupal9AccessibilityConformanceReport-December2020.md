## Overview

This archived ACR reflects the state of our Drupal 9 distribution as of December 2020. It captures the WCAG 2.1 AA evaluation results that informed early project rollouts.

- **Scope:** Early Drupal 9 build with baseline theming and authenticated user flows.
- **Methodology:** Manual keyboard and screen-reader testing, automated axe scans, and code review.
- **Status:** Most success criteria met; remediation tracked for media captions, table summaries, and a few form label edge cases.

## Notes on currency

The distribution has evolved since this report. For current conformance details, refer to the latest [Drupal 9 ACR](./Drupal9AccessibilityConformanceReport/) or request an updated VPAT.
