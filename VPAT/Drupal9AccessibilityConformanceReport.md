## Summary

This VPAT captures how the CivicActions Drupal 9 distribution aligns with the Revised Section 508 standards and WCAG 2.1 Level AA. It distills findings from manual testing, automated scans, and code review.

- **Audience:** Procurement, security, and compliance reviewers assessing Drupal 9 accessibility.
- **Highlights:** Keyboard-accessible navigation and forms, consistent headings/landmarks, and color contrast passing WCAG thresholds.
- **Exceptions:** A small number of embedded media assets require transcripts or captions; third-party widgets should be evaluated per project.
