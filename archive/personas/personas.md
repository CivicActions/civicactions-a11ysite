Our team relies on a small set of personas to make sure accessibility needs are considered during planning, design, and development. Each persona highlights different assistive technologies, pain points, and goals so cross-functional teams can build with empathy.

- [Avery](./accessibility-avery/) — low-vision screen reader user focused on research tasks.
- [Darcy](./designer-darcy/) — designer balancing creativity with contrast and layout requirements.
- [Emery](./engineer-emery/) — developer who cares about semantic HTML and automated checks.
- [Parker](./procurement-parker/) — procurement lead who evaluates vendor accessibility claims.
- [Quincy](./qa-quincy/) — tester validating flows with keyboard and assistive tech.
- [Raz](./remote-raz/) — remote worker navigating cognitive load and time-boxed tasks.

These personas are living documents. Keep them updated with new findings from research sessions, bug reports, and user feedback so they stay useful for backlog grooming and design reviews.
